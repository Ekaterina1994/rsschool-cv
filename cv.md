## About me

After receiving my philological education, I worked for several years as an assistant director at the Writers' Union. In addition to the main duties of the secretary, I helped the authors to edit and make up manuscripts.
Later I had the experience of organizing and conducting international literary competitions for children and teenagers.
Now I work as a copywriter in the field of show business. However, recently my interests have changed. Now I want to become a front-end developer. I hope that my dream will become a reality soon.
