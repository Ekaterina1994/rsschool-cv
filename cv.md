## Code example

Task "Multiples of 3 or 5": 

> Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.  Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).
> Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

```
function solution(number){
  let result = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < number; i++) {
    if(i % 3 === 0 || i % 5 === 0) {
      result += +i;
    }
  }
  return result;
}
